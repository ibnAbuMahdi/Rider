# Hourly Tracking Integration Test Summary

## Changes Made to Integrate Per-Hour Rate Type Tracking

### 1. **LocationService Integration** (`/mnt/c/Users/Ruhullah/dev/Rider/lib/src/core/services/location_service.dart`)

**Added:**
- Import of `HourlyTrackingService`
- Instance variable `_hourlyTrackingService`
- `_startHourlyTrackingIfNeeded()` method
- `_updateHourlyTrackingForAssignments()` method
- Integration in `startTracking()` method
- Integration in `stopTracking()` method
- Integration in `updateGeofenceAssignments()` method

**Logic:**
- Automatically detects geofences with `rate_type == 'per_hour'`
- Starts `HourlyTrackingService` when per-hour geofences are detected
- Stops hourly tracking when no per-hour geofences remain
- Handles dynamic geofence assignment changes

### 2. **HomeScreen UI Enhancement** (`/mnt/c/Users/Ruhullah/dev/Rider/lib/src/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`)

**Added:**
- Enabled current geofence session info display
- Rate-type-specific information display:
  - Shows distance for `per_km` and `hybrid` rates
  - Shows time in minutes for `per_hour`, `hybrid`, and `fixed_daily` rates
- Live tracking stats that update based on rate type

**UI Features:**
- Green badge shows "In [GeofenceName]" when rider is in geofence
- Displays current session distance for distance-based rates
- Displays current session time for time-based rates
- Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds when tracking is active

### 3. **HiveService Storage Support** (`/mnt/c/Users/Ruhullah/dev/Rider/lib/src/core/storage/hive_service.dart`)

**Added Methods:**
- `saveHourlyTrackingWindow()` - Save current window state
- `saveCompletedHourlyWindow()` - Save completed windows
- `getCompletedHourlyWindows()` - Retrieve completed windows
- `clearCompletedHourlyWindows()` - Clear storage
- `saveBackendEarningsCalculation()` - Store backend calculations
- `getBackendEarningsCalculation()` - Retrieve backend calculations
- `clearBackendEarningsCalculation()` - Clear calculations

## Integration Flow

### When Rider Gets Per-Hour Assignment:

1. **Campaign Provider** detects active geofence assignments
2. **Campaign Provider** calls `LocationService.startTracking()`
3. **LocationService** calls `_startHourlyTrackingIfNeeded()`
4. **LocationService** detects `per_hour` rate type in assignments
5. **HourlyTrackingService** starts with:
   - 5-minute GPS sampling intervals
   - Working hours validation (7 AM - 6 PM)
   - Quality control and retry logic
   - Window-based earnings calculation

### During Per-Hour Tracking:

1. **HourlyTrackingService** samples location every 5 minutes
2. **LocationService** continues standard per-km tracking (for hybrid support)
3. **HomeScreen** displays live stats:
   - Current rate: "₦500/hr" 
   - Time in current geofence: "25min"
   - Current earnings from both services
4. **Auto-refresh** updates UI every 3 seconds

### At Hour Boundaries:

1. **HourlyTrackingService** finalizes current window
2. **HourlyTrackingService** submits tracking data to backend
3. **Backend** calculates authoritative earnings
4. **HourlyTrackingService** shows notification with earnings
5. **HourlyTrackingService** starts new tracking window

### When Assignment Changes:

1. **Campaign Provider** calls `LocationService.updateGeofenceAssignments()`
2. **LocationService** calls `_updateHourlyTrackingForAssignments()`
3. **System** stops/starts/restarts hourly tracking as needed
4. **UI** updates to reflect new rate types and tracking modes

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ **Automatic Rate Type Detection**
- System automatically detects `per_hour` rate types
- Starts appropriate tracking service without user intervention
- Supports multiple rate types simultaneously (hybrid)

### ✅ **UI Rate Type Awareness**
- Shows "₦500/hr" for per-hour rates
- Shows "₦10/km" for per-km rates  
- Shows "₦10/km + ₦500/hr" for hybrid rates
- Displays relevant metrics (time vs distance) based on rate type

### ✅ **Working Hours Validation**
- Only tracks during 7 AM - 6 PM window
- Backend validates working hours compliance
- UI shows tracking status during working hours

### ✅ **Quality Control**
- GPS accuracy requirements (50m threshold)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Minimum 2 samples for valid billing
- 10-minute minimum billable time with rounding up

### ✅ **Backend Integration**
- Mobile submits hourly windows to backend
- Backend performs authoritative calculations
- Backend validates all mobile data
- System stores backend results locally

### ✅ **Real-Time Feedback**
- Live tracking stats update every 3 seconds
- Shows current geofence time and earnings
- Green badge indicates active geofence presence
- Notifications for completed earnings calculations

## Testing Required

1. **Assignment Detection**: Assign rider to per-hour geofence
2. **Tracking Start**: Verify hourly tracking starts automatically  
3. **UI Display**: Check that rate shows as "₦XXX/hr"
4. **Time Display**: Verify minutes are shown when in geofence
5. **Working Hours**: Test outside 7 AM - 6 PM window
6. **Assignment Change**: Switch from per-km to per-hour assignment
7. **Backend Integration**: Verify hourly windows are submitted to backend
8. **Earnings Calculation**: Check that backend calculations are used

## Benefits

- **Seamless Experience**: Users don't need to manually switch tracking modes
- **Accurate Earnings**: Backend-authoritative calculations ensure accuracy
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users see live time and earnings updates
- **Quality Assurance**: Robust GPS validation and working hours compliance
- **Flexible Support**: System handles per-km, per-hour, hybrid, and fixed-daily rates
- **Performance Optimized**: Different sampling rates for different rate types (5min vs 30sec)

The integration is complete and ready for testing. The system will automatically handle per-hour rate types with appropriate UI feedback and backend integration.
